# AdvantageScout
Prototype of web based 6328 scouting system for 2020 season. Plan is to connect devices over Bluetooth PAN and build it as a full 'web app' using javascript to avoid issues from unreliable connections. Working on an optional new 'visual scouting' system using the HTML5 canvas element.

To run the prototype, navigate to the main directory in command prompt/terminal and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]` then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:[port]/prototype
